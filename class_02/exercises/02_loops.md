# Exercises: Loops

## Log every number from 0 to 10

## Log every number from 4 to -16

## Log every fourth number from 8 to 41

## The Classic `Fizzbuzz` Program

Loop from 0 to 100.

- If the number is evenly divisible by 3, log the number and `"Fizz"`
- If the number is evenly divisible by 5, log the number and `"buzz"`
- If the number is evenly divisible by both 3 *AND* 5, log the number and `"Fizzbuzz"`

Hint: Use the [**remainder operator**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Remainder) (an explanation can be found [here](https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/fundamentals/modulus))

## Bonus: Times Tables

Log your 9 times tables (up to `9 * 12`).

The logs should appear something like this:

```raw
"1 x 9 = 9"
"2 x 9 = 18"
"3 x 9 = 27"
```

*Bonus*: Log all of your times tables (e.g. your 1 times tables, 2 times tables, all the way up to your 12 times tables). This is very hard! Try to do it using only two loops (you might need a loop within a loop)
